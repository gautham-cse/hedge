</header>

<main>
<section id="vision">
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
    Modern enterprises face an unprecedented volume and sophistication of cyber threats. Traditional defenses,
    which rely heavily on signatures, manual patching, and human intervention, cannot keep pace with adversaries
    that adapt in real time. Our vision is to deliver a self-healing AI security platform that automatically
    detects, analyzes, and mitigates malware threats—preserving business continuity with minimal disruption.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="what-we-offer">
    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    <p>
    Our platform integrates advanced malware analysis, machine learning, and automated remediation within a
    secure, enterprise-grade architecture.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Intelligent Malware Analysis (Python AI Engine)</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Secure ingestion and analysis of executable samples.</li>
    <li>Enrichment via VirusTotal and other threat intelligence sources.</li>
    <li>Static analysis: binary structure, imports, entropy, and signature/YARA checks.</li>
    <li>Dynamic analysis: sandbox execution and behavioral telemetry collection.</li>
    <li>Feature extraction to identify known malware families and detect novel threats through anomaly detection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Self-Healing AI Model</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Supervised models for known threats and anomaly detection for unknown or novel behavior.</li>
    <li>Continuous learning to improve detection accuracy over time.</li>
    <li>Automated remediation playbooks: quarantine, network blocks, patch orchestration, and signature updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Backend (Go):</strong> Secure upload, authentication, user and sample lifecycle management.</li>
    <li><strong>Frontend (Svelte):</strong> Streamlined interface for sample submission, progress monitoring, and remediation review.</li>
    <li>Designed for secure deployment, auditable actions, and integration with SIEM, SOAR, and EDR systems.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="benefits">
    <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Proactive Defense:</strong> Detects both established and emerging malware.</li>
    <li><strong>Autonomous Response:</strong> Reduces mean time to detection (MTTD) and response (MTTR).</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Improves defenses through every incident and sample.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Minimizes manual triage, enabling security teams to focus on priority tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Enterprise Ready:</strong> Built for scale, compliance, and integration with existing security controls.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="roadmap">
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
    The initial focus is malware analysis and safe automated remediation. Planned extensions include:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Integrated patch management and orchestrated remediation workflows.</li>
    <li>AI-driven threat intelligence correlation and secure sharing.</li>
    <li>Deeper orchestration with security operations platforms for end-to-end automation.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
    This platform represents a shift from reactive security to autonomous resilience. By combining malware analysis,
    machine learning, and self-healing automation, we provide enterprises with the capability to respond to sophisticated
    threats rapidly and reliably—protecting systems, data, and operations with confidence.
